## Iterator Pattern
The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. It separates the logic for iterating over a collection of objects from the collection itself.

The Iterator pattern is used when we want to provide a standard way to traverse a collection of objects in a sequential manner, without exposing the underlying implementation of the collection. It allows us to iterate over collections of objects in a uniform way, regardless of their implementation details.

### Participants
The Iterator pattern consists of the following participants:

- Iterator: This is an interface that defines the methods for traversing a collection of objects.
- Concrete Iterator: This is a class that implements the Iterator interface and provides the implementation for the traversal methods.
- Aggregate: This is an interface that defines the methods for creating an Iterator object.
- Concrete Aggregate: This is a class that implements the Aggregate interface and provides the implementation for the creation of the Iterator object.
### Example
Suppose we have a `MyArrayList` class that implements the `Aggregate` interface and we want to provide a way to iterate over the elements of the list. We can create a `MyArrayListIterator` class that implements the `Iterator` interface and provides the implementation for the `hasNext()` and `next()` methods.

```java
public interface Aggregate {
    Iterator createIterator();
}

public class MyArrayList implements Aggregate {
    private int size;
    private Object[] elements;

    public MyArrayList(int capacity) {
        this.elements = new Object[capacity];
    }

    public void add(Object element) {
        this.elements[size++] = element;
    }

    public Object get(int index) {
        return this.elements[index];
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return this.size;
    }

    @Override
    public Iterator createIterator() {
        return new MyArrayListIterator(this);
    }
}

public interface Iterator {
    boolean hasNext();
    Object next();
}

public class MyArrayListIterator implements Iterator {
    private MyArrayList myArrayList;
    private int index;

    public MyArrayListIterator(MyArrayList myArrayList) {
        this.myArrayList = myArrayList;
        this.index = 0;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return index < myArrayList.getSize();
    }

    @Override
    public Object next() {
        Object element = myArrayList.get(index);
        index++;
        return element;
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `MyArrayList` class implements the `Aggregate` interface and provides the `createIterator()` method that returns a new `MyArrayListIterator` object. The `MyArrayListIterator` class implements the `Iterator` interface and provides the `hasNext()` and `next()` methods to traverse the elements of the `MyArrayList`.

### Conclusion
The Iterator Pattern provides a way to access the elements of a collection of objects sequentially without exposing the underlying representation. It separates the logic for iterating over a collection of objects from the collection itself. By using the Iterator pattern, we can iterate over collections of objects in a uniform way, regardless of their implementation details.
We can use the normal for loop to iterate over the content of MyArrayList, but it will cause issue when the type of data inside MyArrayList changes like it changes from List to array.
